This is a public tree of the SBCL Common Lisp compiler with ITA
patches as used at this time.

This has not been polished.  Patches are for various reasons including
building in blaze/bazel, disapprements about upstream changes, reasons
long forgotten, shutting up some warnings, local hacks and patches
that went size zero long ago without anybody noticing.  Not all people
inside ITA like all these patches.

For comments on what a specific patch is for follow the commit
messages in branch "ita".  I will amend messages as I clarify things.

Branched off f9db2f115794114bffd46b5415865f48cccc73a8.  Personally I
(cracauer) use newer SBCLs for QPX.  In newer SBCLs:

- sbcl-final-hashtable.patch doesn't work, and something about the
  quilt patch is messed up (I committed to the ita branch corrected).

- call-character-macro.patch seems to not work, although it applies
  cleanly.  Maybe it's just the test that's broken.

- there is an issue with bivalent-string-stream.  It fails a test for
  us.  Doug suspects that b6975e22454da9b444dda20bc7ea6bddf3779b52
  caused the problem.  I ran with
  890140aaa5d44a4e0962ccb7f708026662bcb8ca in and out but it fails in
  both.  I seem to have a similar but not identical problem to the one
  described in that commit message.

  Still runs QPX fine, it is only an automated test that fails.  It
  isn't clear whether the specific way in which the tests makes the
  stream is resonsible for this.

  This test uses a good chunk of our Lisp libraries that we should
  probably open source anyway.  Maybe I can properly report the bug
  and add our test to SBCL's later.


I did not add my branch of current SBCL to this as it would be
confusing.  I don't use patches that QPX doesn't need to run queries.
The only new thing that is new is changing the base address of the
dynamic heap which I will commit upstream anyway (need more platforms
for testing).  The patches here mostly apply cleanly.  I will push a
devhead version of my tree to spare people the merges.  But it won't
have new per-patch messages (and some patches removed).

More notes:
- ITA should but does not run SBCL's own tests in our final image
- SBCL is awesome
